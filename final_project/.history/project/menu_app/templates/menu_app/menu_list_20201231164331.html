Hey Lienus
What will be today's topic ?
I am doing my final project. and i am doing a website for a  cofffee/restaurant. i have create most of the modules for now for app called menue app still stuggling with the views a little
and the account app is done just one minor error
so i would like to work on the views of my menue app
Sure
if you want i can send you my code before class so you can understnad structure a biti better
But I have an Idea, if you are interested you can work on password management system. When encryption and decryption will be involved.
Where*
So, you will also be working on seciruty.
I would be intrested but i have been doing the other project already for 2 days and dont want just tuck that away since i already spend quite some time on it :/
and i have to be fiinsihed with the project at the 6th
Okay
Cool
Send me the code
its uplading but will take a while currently there is an issue with my views that i cant fix in the menu_app
the code takes a long time to upload i dont have good internet atm
What is the functionality of this application
its supposed to be a a website for a fictional coffee place where you can order things for pick up
and look at the menue

Hey Sir, I wanted to let you know that I feel like we need to make more progress in our session. I don‚Äôt have the time and the money to keep trying to render things to the front end and it‚Äôs not working. I feel like to often we are stuck and things don‚Äôt work. And we are stuck to long. 
I even feel like less are working since we started the afternoon session with you.  the category module is creating doubles every time you add a new item to the categories..... we changed it even if it was working just fine before. Okay a little bit inefficient due to the fact that there where a 2 modules. But it was working. Then we started changing the two modules which ain‚Äôt really work and tryied to to the drop down list. Which we didn‚Äôt manage either. I know 2 hours is a‚Ä¶
